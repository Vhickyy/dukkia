The front shows Paul Kruger's portrait. On the back is a springbock-antelope, the heraldic animal of the Republic of South Africa. Despite the Gold Krugerrand not having any currency indicator it is considered legal tender. The value is determined according to the price of gold on every business day. The London Gold fixing functions as value indicator.During the first three years of mint, the batch of Krugerrand gold coins was under 50,000 ounces per year. After that, production increased four times and reached its peak of up to 6 million ounces during the oil crisis. In 1986, the apartheid’s imposition of sanctions led to a sharp decline in production which lasted until the abolition of embargo on imports in 1999.",
